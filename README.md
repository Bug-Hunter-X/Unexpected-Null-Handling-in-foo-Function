# Unexpected Null Handling in foo Function

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to unexpected null handling. The `foo` function doesn't explicitly handle cases where null values are passed as arguments, leading to potential errors or unexpected behavior.

## Bug Description

The `foo` function is designed to perform some operations based on the input values `a` and `b`.  However, when `a` or `b` is `null`, the function doesn't explicitly handle this scenario, leading to potential issues.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `node bug.js`.
3. Observe the unexpected behavior when null arguments are used.

## Solution

The bug is resolved by adding explicit checks for null values and handling them appropriately. This can involve either returning an error, using default values, or taking other corrective measures as per the function's requirements.
